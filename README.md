A photo blog utilising Netlify Functions (serverless), MongoDB and React.

## Introduction
This project is inspired and by the work from the video tutorial - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QREj8te1P7VSwhrMf3D3Xt4V6_SRkhu.  I've substantially refactored  JSMastery's code so that it can work as a serverless app hosted on Netlify.  Also refactored the Redux in accordance with current best practice.
